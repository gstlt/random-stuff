## ActiveXperts monitoring software plugin

Plugin script for ActiveXperts monitoring software (http://www.activexperts.com/)

## What it does?
It asks MS Cluster on which node is running specified cluster group. If it's running on a service you've provided to the script, it'll return OK status. Otherwise it'll be shouting at you.

## What for?
When you don't have Linux, you must use what you have. :)

Let me know if you find that useful!
